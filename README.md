# money-tracker

I want to create a PFM app that supports the following user stories: 

User Story: Add Transaction

As a user, I want to add a new transaction with details such as date, amount, type (income/expense), and category, so that I can keep track of my financial activities.
User Story: View Transactions

As a user, I want to view a list of my transactions, showing details like date, amount, type, and category, so that I can quickly review my financial activities.
User Story: Edit Transaction

As a user, I want to edit an existing transaction's details in case I made an error or an update is needed, so that my transaction records are accurate.
User Story: Delete Transaction

As a user, I want to delete a transaction if it was added by mistake or is no longer relevant, so that my financial records are up to date.
User Story: Filter Transactions

As a user, I want to filter transactions based on type (income/expense), category, or date range, so that I can find specific transactions or analyze my finances over a certain period.
User Story: Calculate Total Balance

As a user, I want to see my total balance, calculated as the sum of all income minus the sum of all expenses, so that I can have a quick overview of my financial health.
User Story: Categorize Transactions

As a user, I want to categorize transactions (e.g., groceries, bills, salary) so that I can organize my finances and better understand where my money is going.
User Story: View Spending Summary

As a user, I want to view a summary of my spending, showing total income and expenses, possibly with a breakdown by category, so that I can analyze my spending habits.
User Story: Export Transactions

As a user, I want to export my transactions to a file (e.g., CSV, JSON) that I can save to my device, so that I can keep a backup or use the data in other applications.
User Story: Import Transactions

As a user, I want to import transactions from a file (assuming it matches the application's format) so that I can quickly populate my transaction list without manual entry.
User Story: Set Budgets

As a user, I want to set budget limits for different categories so that I can manage my spending according to my financial goals.
User Story: View Budget Status

As a user, I want to view how much I have spent relative to my set budgets for different categories so that I can make informed decisions about my future spending.
